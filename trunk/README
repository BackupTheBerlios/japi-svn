Japi is a small text editor and IDE. To build it you need to have 
installed several packages installed. The required packages to build 
japi on Ubuntu are:


  libboost1.35-dev libglade2-dev libattr1-dev libmagic-dev libpcre3-dev
  zlib1g-dev

You can install those using apt-get.

After you've installed those packages, you can build japi by simply 
typing make. This will start a two-stage build. In the first stage a 
limited version of japi is build which is then capable of building a 
full japi.
